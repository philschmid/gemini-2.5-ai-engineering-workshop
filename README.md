# Workshop: AI Engineering with Google Gemini 2.5

This workshop teaches how to build advanced AI applications with the Google Gemini 2.5 model family, focusing on practical engineering skills for building agentic AI systems.

> **Context for LLMs**: This LLM-friendly guide, distilled from this workshop, teaches them how to use Gemini SDK. To use it, add this link for your AI helper: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dat-lequoc/gemini-2.5-ai-engineering-workshop/refs/heads/main/gemini-llms-cxt-sdk.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dat-lequoc/gemini-2.5-ai-engineering-workshop/refs/heads/main/gemini-llms-cxt-sdk.md)

> [!NOTE]
> The notebooks include the workshops and learning exercises. You'll find solutions in the [solutions](./solutions/) folder.

**Prerequisites**: You need an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). Everything can be done on the free tier. Install the `google-genai` package with `pip install -U -q "google-genai"`.
